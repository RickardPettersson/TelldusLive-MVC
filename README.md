TelldusLive-MVC
===============

Telldus Live GUI using ASP.NET MVC 5 with RestSharp for OAuth and Newtonsoft Json to convert JSON results to objects.

To get it to work you need your own Telldus Live Consumer Key and Secret and put it in the AppSettings in the Web.config file, then run the MVC project and try it.

No login stuff saves only Consumer key and secret in the web.config all other data in cookies and live data.
